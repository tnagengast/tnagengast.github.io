            <strong><a href="https://winewindow.io/" class="visible-link" target="_blank">Wine Window</a></strong> is my biggest and most exciting project to date. Understanding the problems I wanted to solve had been in the making for over 10 years when I began. Some back story is helpful here to understand what validated this problem to the point that I figured a solution would be valuable to a large, though admittedly niche, population. Beware, oxymorons and bad metaphors lie ahead.

            I've worked in the wine industry since I was 12. My brothers and I started out hooking irrigation line up for our family's newly planted vines on the east side of Paso Robles, California. Being the eldest of the three, it was usually my name that got called out when we needed to get work done out on the winery. Thus, I was child labored into it. And just as any other practice; when you do it a lot, you get pretty good at it. Mowing between the vines turned into cleaning tanks, into transferring wines between barrels, into pouring for tastings from behind the counter, into helping with blends on our kitchen table, into full on harvests at huge wineries a little farther north of us and one way out in Marlborough, New Zealand. One thing remained consitent when I talked to people about wine, whether it was casually with non-industry friends or over the counter during tastings: no one knew what the hell they were doing.
            <br><br>
            Now, when I say <i>no one</i> knew what they were talking about, that very well may be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitome_of_Hyperbole" class="visible-link" target="_blank">epitome of hyperbole</a>, but the point is there was a large disconnect between when consumers thought they should enjoy thier wine and when the winemaker actually thought it would be at it's peak.
            <br><br>
            I knew there had to be a way for the people to have better access to the knowledge of the winery. Knowledge that these wineries <i>want</i> to share to help thier prospective vinophiles feel comfortable and confident when drinking their wine. So that when they share a bottle with their friends, the product is the best it could possibly be. Great experiences with great wine means better business and more of it.

            Welp, an interactive aging chart bundled into a sales & communication tool for wineries and a platform for consumers to finally understand how to properly appreciate their investments. That seems pretty cool right? Right guys? Turns out that a couple weeks after this started rumbling around in my head I was set up to work another tasting. Granted, we've got a unique winery - we're very small, have won many awards, and have a very laid back environment - so we do get some unique characters out there. When the event day came, I made a point to pay attention and get a rough idea of what a high quality user (HQU) might look like for me. I walked away with a lot of personas that day but a few I wanted to focus on were:

            <div class="persona">The Weekend Warrior</div>
            This person is a beast. They'll either live near wine country or have the means to get there easily so that they can visit new wineries and at least one of their favorites come Saturday. They'll have 4 friends with them minimum, outside of their partner and children visiting from college, and they always have a good time. They know just enough about wine to care, but at they end of the day, they're not afraid to ask for "The Red". They have a cellar at home and maybe a second at the lake house. This is an HQU.
            <br><strong>Areas for Opportunity:</strong>

            <div class="persona">The Sidekick</div>
            This person seems like they couldn't care less about wine, but they like drinking it. They do get interested in it when you talk in what I describe to my hot shot Cornell masters winemaker buddy as "Low Valyrian." That day I saw a Sidekick come in asking if we use real oranges in the rhone blend, and if Sprite additions were frowned upon, then walked away with a case and a half under his arm. Some just don't know, and that fine, that's why I'm here. They have a cellar that matches their BFF Weekend Warrior's cellar almost bottle for bottle. This is, perhaps deceptively at first, an HQU.
            <br><strong>Areas for Opportunity:</strong>

            <div class="persona">The Technician</div>
            This person is usually quiet, but they know their stuff and are not afraid to spend money on a wine they appreciate. They're not afraid to appear alone, and they will ask you the hard questions. They read about the winery and there's a specific reason they're in front of the bar. When they travel, they don't need recommendations, everything has been meticulously planned in advance. They have a cellar that's worth 4 times more than my truck. This person in an HQU.
            <br><strong>Areas for Opportunity:</strong>

            <!-- <div class="persona">The Industry Discount</div> -->
            <!-- This person is in The Industry, maybe in production, usually in the tasting room, or possibly in a realated industry (Beer, Cider, Gin, Whiskey, etc). They'll always ask for a discount, unless the wine's really bad, and they'll usually buy a bottle. They have a cellar, but unless a bottle is over $75, it's going to be gone in under 2 weeks. This person could be an HQU, possibly an influencer. -->
            <!-- <br><strong>Areas for Opportunity:</strong> -->

            <!-- <div class="persona">The Grandma</div> -->
            <!-- This person only drinks one type of wine, usually whites. They like to host and they're not afraid to walk away with a case. They <i>are</i> interested in what the winery's doing, but if it goes over their head, they're not to concerned about it. The have a cellar disguised as 2 fridge fulls of Chardonnay. This is a V2 HQU. -->
            <!-- <br><strong>Areas for Opportunity:</strong> -->

            <!-- <div class="persona">The Party Animal</div> -->
            <!-- There to have a good time and dance. They'll take the red, or the white, or whatever you've got behind that bar that isn't empty. Their cellar is their shirt, or your shirt depending on splash dynamics and wind resistance. This is not an HQU. -->
            <!-- <br><strong>Areas for Opportunity:</strong> -->

            <!-- <div class="persona">The Stingy Professor</div> -->
            <!-- This person thinks they know a lot and they want you to think that too. They'll ask for special treatment, ignore any advice you give them, and then walk away empty handed. Their cellar is mostly moth balls, but this vintage was just so great they're going to pick that up with it's get's released. Sure. This is not an HQU. -->

            <br><br>


            By the end of the day, I had talked to between 30 and 50 people and had quick interactions with another 30. There were several core ties I noticed between a lot of the people I talked to:<br>
            - Lack of confidence when comparing wines<br>
            - Uninformed on competition results<br>
            - Had either iPhone or Android<br>
            - Often didn't know when the best time to drink their newly purchased bottle would be<br>
            - Would lose bottles over the hill by letting them sit past their prime<br>


            <br>
            <br>CONSUMERS<br>
            what did consumers feel most uncomfortable discussing<br>
            what do they like most about their favorite wineries<br>
            what frustrated them most about their least favorite wineries<br>
            <br>WINERIES<br>
            Ultimatly, from the wineries perspective, this would be tool for increased communication and exposure to consumers that would or could enjoy thier products and community. When talking to wineries, I began with a single over-arching question and would "yes-and" it from there.<br>
            The most important question I needed answered was: what do you have most difficulty communicating to their consumers?<br>

            So I had an idea, I knew what problems different personas were experiencing, and they were even nice enough to give me suggestions of features that would just be cool to have (and they <i>were</i> cool). But before I threw down the flows like Dante's Peak, I wanted to layout possible constraints. If I was gonna start down a rabbit hole it better be to come out with something I could use.<br>

            Once I had my Big Bucket-O-Problems™, it was time to dig in! There was already a lot of basic functionality needed for just the mvp. Luckily, I was able to steal a lot of the basics from other companies that <i>did</i> have the big budgets for research on things like login feedback and navigation interactions.<br>

            Since it's just me, once I had the sketches and flows planned out, I went right to prototyping. Over the years, I've gotten my dev setup to work faster in code than in a dedicated wireframing tool. Since I would be doing the backend too, it made sense to get the editor up and running.<br>
            <br>
            I didn't worry too much about the backend just yet. I was able to get some basic data in there to make the initial flows make sense for my testers. With the protype built up and working I was getting anxios to test it out. Getting to see the interactions starts to fire even more ideas that I would dump in the the README of the project. Hanging out in the front end with Vue made the prototype seem super realistic and worked great. I would end up doing something similiar when I began getting React Native set up for the mobile interfaces.

        <div class="headline">Test</div>
        <div class="detail">
            At Cinquain Cellars, we have our wine club pick-up parties once a quarter. These turned into my testing grounds.<br>
            I knew I could split up my sprints into 2 week blocks of weekend and night work and chould get up about 6 sprints in with new features that I would choose based on the previous testing.<br>
            Sometimes it would be visual clean ups, sometimes interaction and UX developments, and sometimes backend API functionality.<br>

            The first time I tested it I essentially a prototype. Not everything worked, but it was enough to start putting in front of people.<br>

            <div class="quote">Displaying data is hard.</div>

            We got a lot of eyes on it. There were other winemakers and tasting room managers coming through that I would pitch to. I can't thank my ma enough for being my number one champion. She would pitch even more than I would to her friends in the industry and people just around for some wine and sun in the country (and I gotta say, people <i>love</i> my ma, she's pretty awesome)<br>

            Conclusion probably isn't the best name for this section. I'm still working on it and currently on version 5 I think? I got a distracted with Golang for a while and thought it would be pretty hip to do an api in go with a frontend in React. That was dumb. The base MVP <a href="#">is live right now</a> though and we're using it out at <a href="#">Cinquain Cellars</a> to track our vintages, tasting notes, and awards. The data we have in there is really valuable and our wine club members have been asking for an export to PDF feature for some time to get a print out of our aging chart on the wall in their cellar. There's still long way to go, but with this tech stuff that seems to be the norm. At a certain point, there ain't nothin' to it but to do it.
